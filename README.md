<h1>🎮 How to Play</h1>
Click the Roll button to roll all 10 dice.

Click on any dice to "hold" its value so it doesn’t change when rolling again.

Keep rolling until all 10 dice show the same number.

Once all dice are held and have the same value, you win — and a confetti animation will celebrate your victory!

Click "New Game" to play again.
